We've all been victims of the dreaded telemarketer and other spam phone calls at one time or another. Now with Spamtastic you 
can search any United States domestic phone number to find out who is calling, what carrier they are on, the likelihood that 
the call is spam, and where the call is coming from. With this handy information you can then make a well informed decision on 
what numbers you should be blocking on your smart phone.

Spamtastic is a bootstrap templated web application that uses Axios Promise based API calls to gather information from two
White Pages APIs. After both JSON objects return, it then displays specific information to the user, then updates the Google Maps
with lat-long coordinates to show where the call is coming from.
